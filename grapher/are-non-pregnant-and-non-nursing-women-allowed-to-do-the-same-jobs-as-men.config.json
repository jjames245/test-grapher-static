A value of 0 indicates that there are specific jobs that non-pregnant and non-nursing women explicitly or implicitly cannot perform except in limited circumstances. Both partial and full restrictions on womenâ€™s work are counted as restrictions. For example, if women are only allowed to work in certain jobs within the mining industry, e.g., as health care professionals within mines but not as miners, this is a restriction. A value of 1 indicates there are no restrictions.","hasMapTab":true,"originUrl":"https://ourworldindata.org/women-in-the-labor-force-determinants/","stackMode":"absolute","dimensions":[{"id":6910,"unit":"(1=yes, 0=no)","order":0,"chartId":1190,"property":"y","shortUnit":"(1=yes, 0=no)","tolerance":null,"targetYear":null,"variableId":3343,"displayName":"Women can do the same job as men (1=yes; 0=no)","isProjection":null,"conversionFactor":null},{"id":6911,"unit":null,"order":1,"chartId":1190,"property":"x","shortUnit":null,"tolerance":null,"targetYear":null,"variableId":3035,"displayName":"Female labor force participation rate (%)","isProjection":null,"conversionFactor":null},{"id":6912,"unit":null,"order":2,"chartId":1190,"property":"size","shortUnit":null,"tolerance":null,"targetYear":null,"variableId":72,"displayName":null,"isProjection":null,"conversionFactor":null},{"id":6913,"unit":null,"order":3,"chartId":1190,"property":"color","shortUnit":null,"tolerance":null,"targetYear":null,"variableId":123,"displayName":null,"isProjection":null,"conversionFactor":null}],"isAutoSlug":true,"hasChartTab":false,"isPublished":true,"hideTimeline":true,"selectedData":[],"internalNotes":"","addCountryMode":"disabled","hideRelativeToggle":true,"hideTitleAnnotation":true}
