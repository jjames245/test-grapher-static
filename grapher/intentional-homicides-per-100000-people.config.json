Intentional homicide does not include all intentional killing; the difference is usually in the organization of the killing. Individuals or small groups usually commit homicide, whereas killing in armed conflict is usually committed by fairly cohesive groups of up to several hundred members and is thus usually excluded.","hasMapTab":true,"originUrl":"https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/ourworldindata_unesco-2011-education-hiv-testing-pregnant-women-150x52.png","stackMode":"absolute","dimensions":[{"id":11843,"unit":null,"order":0,"chartId":1625,"property":"y","shortUnit":null,"tolerance":null,"targetYear":null,"variableId":2798,"displayName":null,"isProjection":null,"conversionFactor":null}],"isAutoSlug":true,"hasChartTab":true,"isAutoTitle":true,"isPublished":true,"selectedData":[{"index":0,"entityId":137},{"index":0,"entityId":355},{"index":0,"entityId":302},{"index":0,"entityId":28},{"index":0,"entityId":101},{"index":0,"entityId":107}],"internalNotes":"","addCountryMode":"add-country"}
