The coefficient variation (CV) measures the inequality of caloric intake across a given population. It represents the a statistical measure of the data spread around the mean caloric intake. Higher CV values represent larger levels of dietary inequality. The CV of caloric intake is reported only for developing countries within the Food Security Indicators." /><link rel="canonical" href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/coefficient-of-variation-cv-in-per-capita-caloric-intake" /><meta property="fb:app_id" content="1149943818390250" /><meta property="og:url" content="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/coefficient-of-variation-cv-in-per-capita-caloric-intake" /><meta property="og:title" content="Coefficient of Variation (CV) in per capita caloric intake" /><meta property="og:description" content="The Coefficient of Variation (CV) of the per capita caloric intake in a given population.
