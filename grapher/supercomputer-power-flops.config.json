(FLOPS) is a measure of calculations per second for floating-point operations. Floating-point operations are needed for very large or very small real numbers, or computations that require a large dynamic range. It is therefore a more accurate measured than simply instructions per second.","hasMapTab":false,"originUrl":"","stackMode":"absolute","dimensions":[{"id":11463,"unit":null,"order":0,"chartId":1689,"property":"y","shortUnit":null,"tolerance":null,"targetYear":null,"variableId":65437,"displayName":null,"isProjection":null,"conversionFactor":null}],"isAutoSlug":true,"sourceDesc":"TOP500 Supercomputer Database","hasChartTab":true,"isPublished":true,"selectedData":[{"index":0,"entityId":355}],"internalNotes":"","addCountryMode":"add-country"}
