A value of 0 indicates that there are specific jobs that non-pregnant and non-nursing women explicitly or implicitly cannot perform except in limited circumstances. Both partial and full restrictions on women’s work are counted as restrictions. For example, if women are only allowed to work in certain jobs within the mining industry, e.g., as health care professionals within mines but not as miners, this is a restriction. A value of 1 indicates there are no restrictions." /><link rel="canonical" href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/are-non-pregnant-and-non-nursing-women-allowed-to-do-the-same-jobs-as-men" /><meta property="fb:app_id" content="1149943818390250" /><meta property="og:url" content="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/are-non-pregnant-and-non-nursing-women-allowed-to-do-the-same-jobs-as-men" /><meta property="og:title" content="Are non-pregnant and non-nursing women allowed to do the same jobs as men?" /><meta property="og:description" content="This map plots a binary variable measuring whether there are restrictions to women's work.
