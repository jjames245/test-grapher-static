It is therefore a more accurate measured than simply instructions per second." /><link rel="canonical" href="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/supercomputer-power-flops" /><meta property="fb:app_id" content="1149943818390250" /><meta property="og:url" content="https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/supercomputer-power-flops" /><meta property="og:title" content="Supercomputer Power (FLOPS)" /><meta property="og:description" content="The growth of supercomputer power, measured as the number of floating-point operations carried out per second (FLOPS) by the largest supercomputer in any given year.
