Calculated multiplying PWT(9.0)'s variable \"rgdpo\" by 1.000.000.\n\nTotal GDP (expenditure): Expenditure-side real GDP at chained PPPs (in unit 2011US$). Calculated multiplying PWT(9.0)'s variable \"rgdpe\" by 1.000.000.\n\nPopulation: Population. Calculated multiplying PWT(9.0)'s variable \"pop\" by 1.000.000.\n\nLiving Standard GDP per Capita: Per Capita expenditure-side real GDP at chained PPPs. Calculated dividing Total GDP (expenditure) by Population.\n\nPersons Engaged: Number of persons engaged. Calculated multiplying PWT(9.0)'s variable \"emp\" by 1.000.000.\n\nWork Hours Per Person: Average annual hours worked by persons engaged. Present in PWT(9.0)'s as \"avh\".\n\nWork Hours: Total number of work hours. Calculated multiplying \"Work Hours per Person\" by \"Persons Engaged\".\n\nLabour Productivity: Labour Productivity. Calculated dividing \"Total GDP (output)\" by \"Total number of work hours\".\n\nShare Of Labour Compensation: Share of labour compensation in GDP at current national prices. Present in PWT(9.0) as \"labsh\".\n\nGDP Price Level: Price level of CCON (PPP/XR), price level of USA GDPo in 2011=1.
