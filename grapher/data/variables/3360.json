The average intensity of food deprivation of the undernourished, estimated as the difference between the average dietary energy requirement and the average dietary energy consumption of the undernourished population (food-deprived), is multiplied by the number of undernourished to provide an estimate of the total food deficit in the country, which is then normalized by the total population.","created_at":"2017-07-06T13:03:31.000Z","updated_at":"2018-02-28T13:58:31.000Z","uploaded_at":"2017-07-06T13:03:31.000Z","code":"SN.ITK.DFCT","coverage":"","timespan":"1960-2016","datasetId":563,"variableTypeId":4,"sourceId":2022,"uploaded_by":null,"display":{},"shortUnit":"kilocalories","datasetName":"World Development Indicators - Health","s_id":2022,"s_name":"World Bank – WDI: Depth of the food deficit (kilocalories per person per day)","source":{"id":2022,"name":"World Bank – WDI: Depth of the food deficit (kilocalories per person per day)","dataPublishedBy":"World Bank – World Development Indicators","dataPublisherSource":"Food and Agriculture Organization, Food Security Statistics.","link":"http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators","retrievedData":"","additionalInfo":"Statistical concept and methodology: The indicator is calculated as an average over 3 years.\n"}}},"entityKey":{}}
