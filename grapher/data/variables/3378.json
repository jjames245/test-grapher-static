Improved sanitation facilities are likely to ensure hygienic separation of human excreta from human contact. They include flush/pour flush (to piped sewer system, septic tank, pit latrine), ventilated improved pit (VIP) latrine, pit latrine with slab, and composting toilet.","created_at":"2017-07-06T13:03:31.000Z","updated_at":"2018-02-28T13:58:31.000Z","uploaded_at":"2017-07-06T13:03:31.000Z","code":"SH.STA.ACSN.UR","coverage":"","timespan":"1960-2016","datasetId":563,"variableTypeId":4,"sourceId":2040,"uploaded_by":null,"display":{},"shortUnit":"%","datasetName":"World Development Indicators - Health","s_id":2040,"s_name":"World Bank – WDI: Improved sanitation facilities, urban (% of urban population with access)","source":{"id":2040,"name":"World Bank – WDI: Improved sanitation facilities, urban (% of urban population with access)","dataPublishedBy":"World Bank – World Development Indicators","dataPublisherSource":"WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) for Water Supply and Sanitation (http://www.wssinfo.org/).","link":"http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators","retrievedData":"","additionalInfo":"Limitations and exceptions: The data are derived by the Joint Monitoring Programme of the World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) based on national censuses and nationally representative household surveys.
