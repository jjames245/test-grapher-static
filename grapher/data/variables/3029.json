Purchasing power parity (PPP) GDP is GDP converted to 2011 constant international dollars using PPP rates.

However, there are still significant limitations on the availability of reliable data. Information on consistent series of output in both national currencies and purchasing power parity dollars is not easily available, especially in developing countries, because the definition, coverage, and methodology are not always consistent across countries. For example, countries employ different methodologies for estimating the missing values for the nonmarket service sectors and use different definitions of the informal sector.\nGeneral comments: Data up to 2016 are estimates while data from 2017 are projections.\nStatistical concept and methodology: GDP per person employed represents labor productivity — output per unit of labor input. To compare labor productivity levels across countries, GDP is converted to international dollars using purchasing power parity rates which take account of differences in relative prices between countries.\n"}}},"entityKey":{}}
