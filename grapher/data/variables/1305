The reason for doing this is that 1770 is the earliest available data from his paper and I chose that as the start year for the chart.\n\nThen I took Riley's estimate for 'Period when earliest health transition in region began' and assigned the 'Life expectancy before health transition' to the mid-point of that period.\n\nFrom then on I show Riley's data until 1990 where his dataset ends.\n\n\n\nFor 2000 and later estimates:\n\nAfrica: WHO for world region 'Africa'\n\nAmericas: WHO for world region 'Americas'\n\nAsia: World Bank population weighted average of all countries in Riley's definition of Asia http://www.lifetable.de/cgi-bin/countryR.plx?c=Asia\n\nFormer Soviet Union countries: World Bank population weighted average of former Soviet countries ( Russian Federation, Ukraine, Republic of Belarus, Republic of Uzbekistan, Republic of Kazakhstan, Georgia, Republic of Azerbaijan, Republic of Lithuania, Republic of Moldova, Republic of Latvia, Kyrgyz Republic, Republic of Tajikistan, Republic of Armenia, Turkmenistan, and Republic of Estonia.)\n\nEurope: Riley's definition of Europe is this: http://www.lifetable.de/cgi-bin/countryR.plx?c=Europe The data here is from the World Bank \n\nWorld Bank: Population weighted average of all countries in Riley's definition of Oceania http://www.lifetable.de/RileyBib.htm)"}}}}
