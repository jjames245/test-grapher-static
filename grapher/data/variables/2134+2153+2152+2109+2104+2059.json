Although estimates of global carbon dioxide emissions are probably accurate within 10 percent (as calculated from global average fuel chemistry and use), country estimates may have larger error bounds. Trends estimated from a consistent time series tend to be more accurate than individual values.\n\nEach year the CDIAC recalculates the entire time series since 1949, incorporating recent findings and corrections. Estimates exclude fuels supplied to ships and aircraft in international transport because of the difficulty of apportioning the fuels among benefiting countries.\nStatistical concept and methodology: Carbon dioxide emissions, largely by-products of energy production and use, account for the largest share of greenhouse gases, which are associated with global warming. Anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions result primarily from fossil fuel combustion and cement manufacturing. In combustion different fossil fuels release different amounts of carbon dioxide for the same level of energy use: oil releases about 50 percent more carbon dioxide than natural gas, and coal releases about twice as much. Cement manufacturing releases about half a metric ton of carbon dioxide for each metric ton of cement produced. Data for carbon dioxide emissions include gases from the burning of fossil fuels and cement manufacture, but excludes emissions from land use such as deforestation. The unit of measurement is kt (kiloton). Carbon dioxide emissions are often calculated and reported as elemental carbon. The were converted to actual carbon dioxide mass by multiplying them by 3.667 (the ratio of the mass of carbon to that of carbon dioxide).\n"}},"2104":{"years":[],"entities":[],"values":[],"id":2104,"name":"Methane emissions (kt of CO2 equivalent)","unit":"kt of CO2 equivalent","description":"Methane emissions are those stemming from human activities such as agriculture and from industrial methane production.","created_at":"2017-07-06T12:22:00.000Z","updated_at":"2018-02-28T13:58:29.000Z","uploaded_at":"2017-07-06T12:22:00.000Z","code":"EN.ATM.METH.KT.CE","coverage":"","timespan":"1960-2016","datasetId":554,"variableTypeId":4,"sourceId":766,"uploaded_by":null,"display":{},"shortUnit":null,"datasetName":"World Development Indicators - Environment","s_id":766,"s_name":"World Bank – WDI: Methane emissions (kt of CO2 equivalent)","source":{"id":766,"name":"World Bank – WDI: Methane emissions (kt of CO2 equivalent)","dataPublishedBy":"World Bank – World Development Indicators","dataPublisherSource":"European Commission, Joint Research Centre (JRC)/Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency (PBL).
