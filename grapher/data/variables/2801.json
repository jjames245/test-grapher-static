This is done because people may have been displaced more than once.","created_at":"2017-07-06T12:41:05.000Z","updated_at":"2018-02-28T13:58:30.000Z","uploaded_at":"2017-07-06T12:41:05.000Z","code":"VC.IDP.NWDS","coverage":"","timespan":"1960-2016","datasetId":558,"variableTypeId":4,"sourceId":1463,"uploaded_by":null,"display":{},"shortUnit":null,"datasetName":"World Development Indicators - Public Sector","s_id":1463,"s_name":"World Bank – WDI: Internally displaced persons, new displacement associated with disasters (number of cases)","source":{"id":1463,"name":"World Bank – WDI: Internally displaced persons, new displacement associated with disasters (number of cases)","dataPublishedBy":"World Bank – World Development Indicators","dataPublisherSource":"The Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (http://www.internal-displacement.org/)","link":"http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators","retrievedData":"","additionalInfo":"Limitations and exceptions: Please note that most of the figures are estimates. The definition highlights two issues:\n\n1) The coercive or otherwise involuntary character of movement. The definition mentions some of the most common causes of involuntary movements, such as armed conflict, violence, human rights violations and disasters. These causes have in common that they give no choice to people but to leave their homes and deprive them of the most essential protection mechanisms, such as community networks, access to services, livelihoods. Displacement severely affects the physical, socio-economic and legal safety of people and should be systematically regarded as an indicator of potential vulnerability.\n \n2) The fact that such movement takes place within national borders. Unlike refugees, who have been deprived of the protection of their state of origin, IDPs remain legally under the protection of national authorities of their country of habitual residence. IDPs should therefore enjoy the same rights as the rest of the population. The Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement remind national authorities and other relevant actors of their responsibility to ensure that IDPs' rights are respected and fulfilled, despite the vulnerability generated by their displacement.\nStatistical concept and methodology: Internally displaced persons are \"persons or groups of persons who have been forced or obliged to flee or to leave their homes or places of habitual residence, in particular as a result of or in order to avoid the effects of armed conflict, situations of generalized violence, violations of human rights or natural or human-made disasters, and who have not crossed an internationally recognized state border.\" Internally displaced people are often confused with refugees. Unlike refugees, internally displaced people remain under the protection of their own government, even if their reason for fleeing was similar to that of refugees. Refugees are people who have crossed an international border to find sanctuary and have been granted refugee or refugee-like status or temporary protection.\n"}}},"entityKey":{}}
