Calculated as the weighted-average efficiency of lighting in the United Kingdom. Calculated based on percentage share and efficiency data of lighting sources from Fouquet & Pearson (2006). Data represents the national average efficiency, calculated as the sum of (% share * efficiency) of each source.\n\nFor example: (share of lighting from candles * efficiency of candles) + (share of lighting from whale oil * efficiency of whale oil) + (share of lighting from kerosene * efficiency of kerosene).\n\nEfficiency is measured in lumen-hours per kilowatt-hour.\n\nReference:\n\nFouquet, R and Pearson, P J G (2006): ‘Seven Centuries of Energy Services: The Price and Use of Light in the United Kingdom (1300-2000)’, The Energy Journal, 27(1).
