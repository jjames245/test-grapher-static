When the number is smaller than 0.05%, the percentage may appear as zero. In countries where the fiscal year begins in July, expenditure data have been allocated to the later calendar year (for example, 2010 data will cover the fiscal year 2009–10), unless otherwise stated for the country.\nStatistical concept and methodology: Health expenditure data are broken down into public and private expenditures. In general, low-income economies have a higher share of private health expenditure than do middle- and high-income countries, and out-of-pocket expenditure (direct payments by households to providers) makes up the largest proportion of private expenditures. High out-of-pocket expenditures may discourage people from accessing preventive or curative care and can impoverish households that cannot afford necessary care. Health financing data are collected through national health accounts, which systematically, comprehensively, and consistently monitor health system resource flows. To establish a national health account, countries must define the boundaries of the health system and classify health expenditure information along several dimensions, including sources of financing, providers of health services, functional use of health expenditures, and beneficiaries of expenditures. The accounting system can then provide an accurate picture of resource envelopes and financial flows and allow analysis of the equity and efficiency of financing to inform policy.\n"}},"96430":{"years":[],"entities":[],"values":[],"id":96430,"name":"GDP per capita","unit":"2011 int-$","description":null,"createdAt":"2018-03-28T16:36:42.000Z","updatedAt":"2018-03-28T16:36:42.000Z","code":null,"coverage":"","timespan":"","datasetId":2699,"sourceId":15442,"shortUnit":null,"display":{},"columnOrder":0,"datasetName":"Penn World Table","s_id":15442,"s_name":"GDP per capita","source":{"id":15442,"name":"GDP per capita","dataPublishedBy":"University of Groningen","dataPublisherSource":"Feenstra, Robert C., Robert Inklaar and Marcel P.
