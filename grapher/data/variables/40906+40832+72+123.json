A qualified teacher is one who has the minimum academic qualifications necessary to teach at a specific level of education in a given country. This is usually related to the subject(s) they teach. The percentage of qualified teachers should not exceed 100%. When feasible, the number of part-time teachers should be converted to ‘full-time equivalent’ numbers of teachers; a double-shift teacher should be counted twice, etc. Ideally, all staff involved in direct classroom-teaching roles should be included in the calculations. High values indicate that students are being taught by teachers who are academically well qualified in the subjects they teach.","created_at":"2017-09-10T16:24:06.000Z","updated_at":"2018-02-28T13:58:51.000Z","uploaded_at":"2017-09-10T16:24:06.000Z","code":"UIS.QUTP.1","coverage":"","timespan":"1970-2100","datasetId":886,"variableTypeId":4,"sourceId":5412,"uploaded_by":null,"display":{},"shortUnit":"%","datasetName":"World Bank EdStats - Teachers","s_id":5412,"s_name":"World Bank EdStats: Percentage of teachers in primary education who are qualified, both sexes (%)","source":{"id":5412,"name":"World Bank EdStats: Percentage of teachers in primary education who are qualified, both sexes (%)","dataPublishedBy":"World Bank EdStats","dataPublisherSource":"UNESCO Institute for Statistics","link":"https://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/ed-stats","retrievedData":"","additionalInfo":""}}},"entityKey":{}}
