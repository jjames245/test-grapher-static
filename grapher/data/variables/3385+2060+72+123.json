Although estimates of global carbon dioxide emissions are probably accurate within 10 percent (as calculated from global average fuel chemistry and use), country estimates may have larger error bounds. Trends estimated from a consistent time series tend to be more accurate than individual values.\n\nEach year the CDIAC recalculates the entire time series since 1949, incorporating recent findings and corrections. Estimates exclude fuels supplied to ships and aircraft in international transport because of the difficulty of apportioning the fuels among benefiting countries.\nStatistical concept and methodology: Carbon dioxide emissions, largely by-products of energy production and use, account for the largest share of greenhouse gases, which are associated with global warming. Anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions result primarily from fossil fuel combustion and cement manufacturing. In combustion different fossil fuels release different amounts of carbon dioxide for the same level of energy use: oil releases about 50 percent more carbon dioxide than natural gas, and coal releases about twice as much. Cement manufacturing releases about half a metric ton of carbon dioxide for each metric ton of cement produced. Data for carbon dioxide emissions include gases from the burning of fossil fuels and cement manufacture, but excludes emissions from land use such as deforestation.\n"}},"3385":{"years":[],"entities":[],"values":[],"id":3385,"name":"Life expectancy at birth, total (years)","unit":"years","description":"Life expectancy at birth indicates the number of years a newborn infant would live if prevailing patterns of mortality at the time of its birth were to stay the same throughout its life.","created_at":"2017-07-06T13:03:32.000Z","updated_at":"2018-02-28T13:58:31.000Z","uploaded_at":"2017-07-06T13:03:32.000Z","code":"SP.DYN.LE00.IN","coverage":"","timespan":"1960-2016","datasetId":563,"variableTypeId":4,"sourceId":2047,"uploaded_by":null,"display":{},"shortUnit":"years","datasetName":"World Development Indicators - Health","s_id":2047,"s_name":"World Bank – WDI: Life expectancy at birth, total (years)","source":{"id":2047,"name":"World Bank – WDI: Life expectancy at birth, total (years)","dataPublishedBy":"World Bank – World Development Indicators","dataPublisherSource":"Derived from male and female life expectancy at birth from sources such as: (1) United Nations Population Division.

Therefore they may not reflect real events as much as observed data.\nStatistical concept and methodology: Life expectancy at birth used here is the average number of years a newborn is expected to live if mortality patterns at the time of its birth remain constant in the future. It reflects the overall mortality level of a population, and summarizes the mortality pattern that prevails across all age groups in a given year. It is calculated in a period life table which provides a snapshot of a population's mortality pattern at a given time. It therefore does not reflect the mortality pattern that a person actually experiences during his/her life, which can be calculated in a cohort life table.\n\nHigh mortality in young age groups significantly lowers the life expectancy at birth. But if a person survives his/her childhood of high mortality, he/she may live much longer. For example, in a population with a life expectancy at birth of 50, there may be few people dying at age 50. The life expectancy at birth may be low due to the high childhood mortality so that once a person survives his/her childhood, he/she may live much longer than 50 years.\n"}}},"entityKey":{}}
