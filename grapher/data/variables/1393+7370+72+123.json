Specifically, we excluded the observations where the ICTD indicated concerns about their quality, accuracy or comparability.

Reassessing Tax and Development Research: A New Dataset, New Findings, and Lessons for Research. World Development, 80, 48-60.\n\nThe November 2017 version of the ICTD dataset differs from the previous release because of minor revisions to metadata, corrections made to 'Total Revenue' figures for Tunisia, and the addition of a GDP series to the 'merged' file. Revisions made in the <a href=\"https://www.wider.unu.edu/sites/default/files/Data/2017-GRD-Updates.pdf\">July 2017 update</a> are outlined in the linked supporting documentation. \n\nFor more details on the Government Revenue Dataset see its <a href=\"https://www.wider.unu.edu/about-grd\">update history</a>.

These individual measures of governance are assigned to categories capturing key dimensions of governance. An unobserved component model is used to construct six aggregate governance indicators. Point estimates of the dimensions of governance, the margins of error as well as the number of sources are presented for each country. The governance estimates are normally distributed with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one each year of measurement. This implies that virtually all scores lie between -2.5 and 2.5, with higher scores corresponding to better outcomes.\\ \\WARNING: Since the estimates are standardized (with a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one) each year of measurement, they are not directly suitable for over-time comparisons within countries. Kaufmann et al. (2006) however find no systematic time-trends in a selection of indicators that do allow for comparisons over time, which suggests that time-series information in the WBGI scores can be used if interpreted with caution."}}},"entityKey":{}}
