It is calculated without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets or for depletion and degradation of natural resources.

Divide the total number of pupils enrolled at the specified level of education by the number of qualified teachers at the same level. A qualified teacher is one who has the minimum academic qualifications necessary to teach at a specific level of education in a given country. This is usually related to the subject(s) they teach. In computing and interpreting this indicator, one should take into account the existence of part-time teaching, school-shifts, multi-grade classes and other practices that may affect the precision and meaningfulness of pupil-teacher ratios. When feasible, the number of part-time teachers is converted to ‘full-time equivalent’ teachers; a double-shift teacher is counted twice, etc. Teachers are defined as persons whose professional activity involves the transmitting of knowledge, attitudes and skills that are stipulated in a formal curriculum programme to students enrolled in a formal educational institution.","created_at":"2017-09-10T16:24:07.000Z","updated_at":"2018-02-28T13:58:51.000Z","uploaded_at":"2017-09-10T16:24:07.000Z","code":"UIS.PTRHC.1.QUALIFIED","coverage":"","timespan":"1970-2100","datasetId":886,"variableTypeId":4,"sourceId":5417,"uploaded_by":null,"display":{},"shortUnit":null,"datasetName":"World Bank EdStats - Teachers","s_id":5417,"s_name":"World Bank EdStats: Pupil/qualified teacher ratio in primary education (headcount basis)","source":{"id":5417,"name":"World Bank EdStats: Pupil/qualified teacher ratio in primary education (headcount basis)","dataPublishedBy":"World Bank EdStats","dataPublisherSource":"UNESCO Institute for Statistics","link":"https://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/ed-stats","retrievedData":"","additionalInfo":""}}},"entityKey":{}}
