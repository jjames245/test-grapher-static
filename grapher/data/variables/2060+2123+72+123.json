Although estimates of global carbon dioxide emissions are probably accurate within 10 percent (as calculated from global average fuel chemistry and use), country estimates may have larger error bounds. Trends estimated from a consistent time series tend to be more accurate than individual values.\n\nEach year the CDIAC recalculates the entire time series since 1949, incorporating recent findings and corrections. Estimates exclude fuels supplied to ships and aircraft in international transport because of the difficulty of apportioning the fuels among benefiting countries.\nStatistical concept and methodology: Carbon dioxide emissions, largely by-products of energy production and use, account for the largest share of greenhouse gases, which are associated with global warming. Anthropogenic carbon dioxide emissions result primarily from fossil fuel combustion and cement manufacturing. In combustion different fossil fuels release different amounts of carbon dioxide for the same level of energy use: oil releases about 50 percent more carbon dioxide than natural gas, and coal releases about twice as much. Cement manufacturing releases about half a metric ton of carbon dioxide for each metric ton of cement produced. Data for carbon dioxide emissions include gases from the burning of fossil fuels and cement manufacture, but excludes emissions from land use such as deforestation.\n"}},"2123":{"years":[],"entities":[],"values":[],"id":2123,"name":"Renewable electricity output (% of total electricity output)","unit":"% of total electricity output","description":"Renewable electricity is the share of electrity generated by renewable power plants in total electricity generated by all types of plants.","created_at":"2017-07-06T12:22:00.000Z","updated_at":"2018-02-28T13:58:29.000Z","uploaded_at":"2017-07-06T12:22:00.000Z","code":"EG.ELC.RNEW.ZS","coverage":"","timespan":"1960-2016","datasetId":554,"variableTypeId":4,"sourceId":785,"uploaded_by":null,"display":{},"shortUnit":"%","datasetName":"World Development Indicators - Environment","s_id":785,"s_name":"World Bank – WDI: Renewable electricity output (% of total electricity output)","source":{"id":785,"name":"World Bank – WDI: Renewable electricity output (% of total electricity output)","dataPublishedBy":"World Bank – World Development Indicators","dataPublisherSource":"World Bank, Sustainable Energy for All (SE4ALL) database from the SE4ALL Global Tracking Framework led jointly by the World Bank, International Energy Agency, and the Energy Sector Management Assistance Program.","link":"http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators","retrievedData":"","additionalInfo":""}}},"entityKey":{}}
