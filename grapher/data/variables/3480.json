For children up to two years old height is measured by recumbent length. For older children height is measured by stature while standing. The data are based on the WHO's new child growth standards released in 2006.","created_at":"2017-07-06T13:03:36.000Z","updated_at":"2018-02-28T13:58:31.000Z","uploaded_at":"2017-07-06T13:03:36.000Z","code":"SH.STA.STNT.ZS","coverage":"","timespan":"1960-2016","datasetId":563,"variableTypeId":4,"sourceId":2142,"uploaded_by":null,"display":{},"shortUnit":"%","datasetName":"World Development Indicators - Health","s_id":2142,"s_name":"World Bank – WDI: Prevalence of stunting, height for age (% of children under 5)","source":{"id":2142,"name":"World Bank – WDI: Prevalence of stunting, height for age (% of children under 5)","dataPublishedBy":"World Bank – World Development Indicators","dataPublisherSource":"World Health Organization, Global Database on Child Growth and Malnutrition.

Frequent illness saps the nutritional status of those who survive, locking them into a vicious cycle of recurring sickness and faltering growth (UNICEF, www.childinfo.org). Estimates of child malnutrition, based on prevalence of underweight and stunting, are from national survey data. The proportion of underweight children is the most common malnutrition indicator. Being even mildly underweight increases the risk of death and inhibits cognitive development in children. And it perpetuates the problem across generations, as malnourished women are more likely to have low-birth-weight babies. Stunting, or being below median height for age, is often used as a proxy for multifaceted deprivation and as an indicator of long-term changes in malnutrition.\n"}}},"entityKey":{}}
