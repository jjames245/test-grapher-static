The three components were equally weighted (HHI-PD score = [stunting (%) + anemia (%) + low serum retinol (%)]/3).\n\nThe HHI-PD score ranged between the best and worst possible scores of 0 and 100, respectively. Applying arbitrary cut-offs, HHI-PD scores between 0 and 19.9 were considered mild, 20-34.9 as moderate, 35-44.9 as severe, and 45-100 as alarmingly high. Highly developed countries with a 2007 Human Development Index (HDI) score above 0.9 (n=41) were assumed to have a low prevalence of micronutrient deficiencies, and were therefore excluded from this analysis.\n\nData on micronutrient deficiencies used in this index relate to national-level analysis and surveys over the period 1999-2009."}},"96430":{"years":[],"entities":[],"values":[],"id":96430,"name":"GDP per capita","unit":"2011 int-$","description":null,"createdAt":"2018-03-28T16:36:42.000Z","updatedAt":"2018-03-28T16:36:42.000Z","code":null,"coverage":"","timespan":"","datasetId":2699,"sourceId":15442,"shortUnit":null,"display":{},"columnOrder":0,"datasetName":"Penn World Table","s_id":15442,"s_name":"GDP per capita","source":{"id":15442,"name":"GDP per capita","dataPublishedBy":"University of Groningen","dataPublisherSource":"Feenstra, Robert C., Robert Inklaar and Marcel P.
