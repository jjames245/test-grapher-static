Available at: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378016302370?via%3Dihub#bib0330 [accessed 24th August 2017].\n\n'Feed conversion ratio' is defined as the quantity of feed inputs required to produce one kilogram of edible product. This is measured in kilograms of dry-matter feed per kilogram of edible weight product.\n\nProtein and energy efficiency are both measured as the percentage of protein or energy converted from feed to animal product.\n\nOriginal data sources as used in this paper are as follows:\n\nSmil (2013).Should We Eat Meat?
