{"variables":{"39317":{"id":39317,"name":"UIS: Percentage of population age 25+ with at least completed post-secondary education (ISCED 4 or higher). Total","unit":"ISCED 4 or higher. Tota","description":"The percentage of population (age 25 and over) with at least completed post-secondary education (ISCED 4 or higher). This indicator is calculated by dividing the number of persons aged 25 years and above with completed post-secondary education by the total population of the same age group and multiplying the result by 100. The UNESCO Institute for Statistics (UIS) educational attainment dataset shows the educational composition of the population aged 25 years and above and hence the stock and quality of human capital within a country. The dataset also reflects the structure and performance of the education system and its accumulated impact on human capital formation.
