In Belarus, China and Viet Nam, data on the use of the death penalty is\r\nclassified as a state secret. During 2016 little or no information was available on some\r\ncountries – in particular Laos, North Korea (the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea),\r\nSyria and Yemen – due to restrictive state practice and/or armed conflict.\r\nTherefore, with only a few exceptions, Amnesty International’s figures on the use of the death\r\npenalty are minimum figures.\r\nThe true figures are likely to be higher. Where the organization\r\nobtains fuller information on a specific country in a given year this is noted in Amnesty International's report.\r\nIn 2009 Amnesty International stopped publishing its estimated figures on the use of the\r\ndeath penalty in China. Amnesty International always made clear that the figures it was able\r\nto publish on China were significantly lower than the reality, because of the restrictions on\r\naccess to information. Amnesty International’s decision to stop publishing data reflected\r\nconcerns about how the Chinese authorities misrepresented Amnesty International’s\r\nnumbers. Since 2009 the organization challenged China to publish information on the use of\r\nthe death penalty. China has yet to publish any figures on the death penalty. However,\r\navailable information indicates that thousands of people are executed and sentenced to death\r\nin China each year.\" \r\n\r\n"}},"57513":{"id":57513,"name":"Deaths - Road injuries - Sex: Both - Age: All Ages (Number)","unit":"Number","description":null,"created_at":"2017-11-20T20:27:52.000Z","updated_at":"2018-02-28T13:59:00.000Z","uploaded_at":"2017-11-20T20:27:52.000Z","code":"1 689 3 22 1","coverage":"","timespan":"","fk_dst_id":1540,"fk_var_type_id":4,"sourceId":12850,"uploaded_by":null,"display":{"name":"Road accidents","unit":"deaths"},"shortUnit":null,"datasetName":"Road injuries","s_id":12850,"s_name":"Road injuries","source":{"id":12850,"name":"Road injuries","dataPublishedBy":"Global Burden of Disease Collaborative Network.
