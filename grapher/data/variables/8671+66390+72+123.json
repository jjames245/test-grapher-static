The most important update corresponds to the 2015 release of the Groningen Growth and Development Centre’s (GGDC) 10-sector database. However, some other country-specific updates were also considered (e.g. US data published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis). In the attached documentation (https://ourworldindata.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Documentation-for-Historical-employment-and-output-by-sector-%E2%80%93-OWID-2017.pdf) we describe sources and updates, country by country.\n\nFor the rest of the countries, data comes directly from the 2015 release of the GGDC 10-sector database. The only change we applied to the GGDC 10-sector database was dropping observations for GDP shares in Peru 1950-1985 (these are reported as negative in the original)."}},"66390":{"years":[],"entities":[],"values":[],"id":66390,"name":"Real GDP per capita in 2011US$, multiple benchmarks (Maddison Project Database (2018))","unit":"$","description":"Measure of real GDP per capita accounts for inflation, i.e. changes in the price level, and this per capita GDP is suitable for cross-country income comparisons.
