In our dataset we have multiplied it by 1000 to avoid expressing it \"in thousands\".\r\n\r\nThe Maddison region definitions were adapted from the source from Maddison (2010)'s homepage at: http://www.ggdc.net/maddison/oriindex.htm under the heading \"Historical Statistics\" and the file titled: Statistics on World Population, GDP and Per Capita GDP, 1-2008 AD (Horizontal file, copyright Angus Maddison, University of Groningen) \r\n\r\nTo calculate average real GDP per capita across regions, we have calculated a population weight for each country per year by dividing country population in year x by the total regional population. This weight has been used to multiply real GDP per capita (in 2011US$, with multiple benchmarks) to give real regional GDP per capita weighted by population."}}},"entityKey":{}}
