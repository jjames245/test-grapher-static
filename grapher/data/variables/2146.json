There is no consistent and universally accepted standard for distinguishing urban from rural areas, in part because of the wide variety of situations across countries.\n\nMost countries use an urban classification related to the size or characteristics of settlements. Some define urban areas based on the presence of certain infrastructure and services. And other countries designate urban areas based on administrative arrangements. Because of national differences in the characteristics that distinguish urban from rural areas, the distinction between urban and rural population is not amenable to a single definition that would be applicable to all countries.\n\nEstimates of the world's urban population would change significantly if China, India, and a few other populous nations were to change their definition of urban centers. \n\nBecause the estimates of city and metropolitan area are based on national definitions of what constitutes a city or metropolitan area, cross-country comparisons should be made with caution.\nStatistical concept and methodology: Urban population refers to people living in urban areas as defined by national statistical offices. The indicator is calculated using World Bank population estimates and urban ratios from the United Nations World Urbanization Prospects.\n\nPercentages urban are the numbers of persons residing in an area defined as ''urban'' per 100 total population. They are calculated by the Statistics Division of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs. Particular caution should be used in interpreting the figures for percentage urban for different countries.\n\nCountries differ in the way they classify population as \"urban\" or \"rural.\" The population of a city or metropolitan area depends on the boundaries chosen.\n"}}},"entityKey":{}}
