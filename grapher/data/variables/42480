Multiplying these figures allow for the calculation of the absolute number of people undernourished.\n\nThe number of people with sufficient caloric intake (i.e. not undernourished) was calculated as the difference between total population and number of people undernourished.\n\nReferences:\n\nWorld Bank, World Development Indicators. https://data.worldbank.org/indicator [accessed 25th September 2017].\n\nFAO, IFAD, UNICEF, WFP and WHO. 2017.
