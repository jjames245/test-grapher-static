The FAO tries to impose standard definitions and reporting methods, but complete consistency across countries and over time is not possible.\n\nThe data collected from official national sources through the questionnaire are supplemented with information from official secondary data sources. The secondary sources cover official country data from websites of national ministries, national publications and related country data reported by various international organizations.\nStatistical concept and methodology: Total land area does not include inland water bodies such as major rivers and lakes. Variations from year to year may be due to updated or revised data rather than to change in area.\n"}}},"entityKey":{}}
