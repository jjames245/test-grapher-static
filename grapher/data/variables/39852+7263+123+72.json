The HDI can also be used to question national policy choices, asking how two countries with the same level of GNI per capita can end up with different human development outcomes. These contrasts can stimulate debate about government policy priorities.\n\nThe Human Development Index (HDI) is a summary measure of average achievement in key dimensions of human development: a long and healthy life, being knowledgeable and have a decent standard of living. The HDI is the geometric mean of normalized indices for each of the three dimensions.\n\nThe health dimension is assessed by life expectancy at birth, the education dimension is measured by mean of years of schooling for adults aged 25 years and more and expected years of schooling for children of school entering age. The standard of living dimension is measured by gross national income per capita. The HDI uses the logarithm of income, to reflect the diminishing importance of income with increasing GNI. The scores for the three HDI dimension indices are then aggregated into a composite index using geometric mean. Refer to Technical notes for more details.\n\nThe HDI simplifies and captures only part of what human development entails. It does not reflect on inequalities, poverty, human security, empowerment, etc. The HDRO offers the other composite indices as broader proxy on some of the key issues of human development, inequality, gender disparity and human poverty.","created_at":"2017-07-25T16:01:37.000Z","updated_at":"2018-02-28T13:58:33.000Z","uploaded_at":"2017-07-25T16:01:37.000Z","code":"undp_hdi","coverage":"","timespan":"1990 - 2014","datasetId":629,"variableTypeId":4,"sourceId":2724,"uploaded_by":null,"display":{},"shortUnit":"","datasetName":"Public Economy - Quality of Government (2017)","s_id":2724,"s_name":"UNDP via the Quality of Government dataset","source":{"id":2724,"name":"UNDP via the Quality of Government dataset","dataPublishedBy":"The Quality of Government Institute","dataPublisherSource":"UNDP","link":"http://qog.pol.gu.se/data, http://hdr.undp.org/en/data","retrievedData":"","additionalInfo":"The Human Development Report (HDR) is an annual report published by the Human Development Report Office of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)"}},"39852":{"years":[],"entities":[],"values":[],"id":39852,"name":"PISA: Mean performance on the reading scale","unit":"","description":"Average score of 15-year-old students on the PISA reading scale.
