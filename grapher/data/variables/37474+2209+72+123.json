PPP GDP is gross domestic product converted to international dollars using purchasing power parity rates. An international dollar has the same purchasing power over GDP as the U.S. dollar has in the United States. GDP at purchaser's prices is the sum of gross value added by all resident producers in the economy plus any product taxes and minus any subsidies not included in the value of the products. It is calculated without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets or for depletion and degradation of natural resources.

The food balance sheet shows for each food item - i.e. each primary commodity and a number of processed commodities potentially available for human consumption - the sources of supply and its utilization. The total quantity of foodstuffs produced in a country added to the total quantity imported and adjusted to any change in stocks that may have occurred since the beginning of the reference period gives the supply available during that period. On the utilization side a distinction is made between the quantities exported, fed to livestock, used for seed, put to manufacture for food use and non-food uses, losses during storage and transportation, and food supplies available for human consumption. The per caput supply of each such food item available for human consumption is then obtained by dividing the respective quantity by the related data on the population actually partaking of it. Data on per caput food supplies are expressed in terms of quantity and - by applying appropriate food composition factors for all primary and processed products - also in terms of caloric value and protein and fat content.","created_at":"2017-08-29T18:25:16.000Z","updated_at":"2018-02-28T13:58:47.000Z","uploaded_at":"2017-08-29T18:25:16.000Z","code":"2960 - 645","coverage":"","timespan":"","datasetId":843,"variableTypeId":4,"sourceId":3003,"uploaded_by":null,"display":{},"shortUnit":"kg","datasetName":"Food Balance: Food Balance Sheets - FAO (2017)","s_id":3003,"s_name":"Food Balance Sheets - FAO (2017)","source":{"id":3003,"name":"Food Balance Sheets - FAO (2017)","dataPublishedBy":"Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) (2017) ","dataPublisherSource":"The main source is official statistics from FAO member countries.

Using these data and the available information on seed rates, waste coefficients, stock changes and types of utilization (feed, food, processing and other utilization), a supply/utilization account is prepared for each commodity in weight terms. The food component of the commodity account, which is usually derived as a balancing item, refers to the total amount of the commodity available for human consumption during the year. Besides commodity-by-commodity information, the FAO FBS also provide total food availability estimates by aggregating the food component of all commodities including fishery products. From these values and the available population estimates, the per person dietary energy and protein and fat supplies are derived and expressed on a daily basis. In the FBS production data refer only to primary products while data for all other elements also include processed products derived there from, expressed in primary commodity equivalent.\r\n\r\n"}}},"entityKey":{}}
