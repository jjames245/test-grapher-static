Patent applications are worldwide patent applications filed through the Patent Cooperation Treaty procedure or with a national patent office for exclusive rights for an invention--a product or process that provides a new way of doing something or offers a new technical solution to a problem. A patent provides protection for the invention to the owner of the patent for a limited period, generally 20 years.\r\n\r\n\"Scientific and technical journal articles\" which measures the number of scientific and engineering articles published in the following fields: physics, biology, chemistry, mathematics, clinical medicine, biomedical research, engineering and technology, and earth and space sciences.\r\n\r\nWorld Bank, World Development Indicators available at: https://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators\r\n\r\nUN World Population Prospects data available at: http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/theme/trends/index.shtml\r\n"}}},"entityKey":{}}
