Data on literacy rates come from a variety of sources (such as national censuses and surveys) and reporting modes (self-reporting vs household declarations). \r\n\r\nWe have grouped sources under three main types: i) population censuses; ii) surveys; iii) and national estimates. National estimates may include data based on educational attainment or data based on the country's census.\r\n\r\nModes of reporting literacy rates have been grouped into four categories: household declaration, self-declaration, literacy test, and national estimates. UNESCO categorised Chile's (2009) and the Philippines' (2003) mode of literacy reporting as 'Household/Self declaration'. We have categorised the two countries under the household declaration category."}}}}
