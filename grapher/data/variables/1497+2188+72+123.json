In turn, these are measured with respect to two different 'poverty lines': (a) 1.90$ a day and (b) 3.10$ a day. Poverty headcount ratio is a proxy for the 'quantity of poverty', while poverty gap represents the 'intensity of poverty'. A more detailed definition of these two variables is available here. (https://ourworldindata.org/extreme-poverty/#key-definitions).\r\n\r\nConsumption per capita is the preferred welfare indicator for the World Bank’s analysis of global poverty. But not all national statistical agencies report to the World Bank consistent estimates of consumption based on expenditure surveys. For about 25% of the countries, estimates correspond to income, rather than consumption. \r\n\r\nAs a result of revisions in PPP exchange rates, poverty rates for individual countries cannot be compared with poverty rates reported in earlier editions. \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nData and Methodology.\r\n\r\nAccording to the World Bank's definition: \"PovcalNet is an interactive computational tool that allows you to replicate the calculations made by the World Bank's researchers in estimating the extent of absolute poverty in the world\".\r\n\r\nData are based on primary household survey data obtained from government statistical agencies and World Bank country departments. Data for high-income economies are from the Luxembourg Income Study database. For more information and methodology, please see PovcalNet.

Moreover, many countries do not estimate all the components of national expenditures but instead derive some of the main aggregates indirectly using GDP (based on the production approach) as the control total.\r\n\r\nData on exports and imports are compiled from customs reports and balance of payments data. Although the data from the payments side provide reasonably reliable records of cross-border transactions, they may not adhere strictly to the appropriate definitions of valuation and timing used in the balance of payments or corresponds to the change-of ownership criterion. This issue has assumed greater significance with the increasing globalization of international business. Neither customs nor balance of payments data usually capture the illegal transactions that occur in many countries. Goods carried by travelers across borders in legal but unreported shuttle trade may further distort trade statistics.\r\nStatistical concept and methodology: Gross domestic product (GDP) from the expenditure side is made up of household final consumption expenditure, general government final consumption expenditure, gross capital formation (private and public investment in fixed assets, changes in inventories, and net acquisitions of valuables), and net exports (exports minus imports) of goods and services. Such expenditures are recorded in purchaser prices and include net taxes on products.\r\n\r\nFor the overlapping years, this series coincides with the data published in WITS variable titled \"Exports Of Goods And Services (% Of GDP)\"."}}},"entityKey":{}}
