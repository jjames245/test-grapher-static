{"variables":{"41361":{"years":[],"entities":[],"values":[],"id":41361,"name":"Total net enrolment rate, primary, both sexes (%)","unit":"%","description":"Total number of students of the official age group for primary education who are enrolled in any level of education, expressed as a percentage of the corresponding population. Divide the total number of students in the official school age range for primary education who are enrolled in any level of education by the population of the same age group and multiply the result by 100. The difference between the total NER and the adjusted NER provides a measure of the proportion of children in the official relevant school age group who are enrolled in levels of education below the one intended for their age. The difference between the total NER and the adjusted NER for primary education is due to enrolment in pre-primary education. The total NER should be based on total enrolment of the official relevant school age group in any level of education for all types of schools and education institutions, including public, private and all other institutions that provide organized educational programmes.","created_at":"2017-09-10T17:30:29.000Z","updated_at":"2018-02-28T13:58:51.000Z","uploaded_at":"2017-09-10T17:30:29.000Z","code":"UIS.NERT.1","coverage":"","timespan":"1970-2100","datasetId":898,"variableTypeId":4,"sourceId":5867,"uploaded_by":null,"display":{},"shortUnit":"%","datasetName":"World Bank EdStats - Primary","s_id":5867,"s_name":"World Bank EdStats: Total net enrolment rate, primary, both sexes (%)","source":{"id":5867,"name":"World Bank EdStats: Total net enrolment rate, primary, both sexes (%)","dataPublishedBy":"World Bank EdStats","dataPublisherSource":"UNESCO Institute for Statistics","link":"https://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/ed-stats","retrievedData":"","additionalInfo":""}}},"entityKey":{}}
