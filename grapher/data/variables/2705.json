The data are obtained through statistical surveys which are regularly conducted at national level covering R & D performing entities in the private and public sectors.\nStatistical concept and methodology: Researchers are professionals engaged in the conception or creation of new knowledge, products, processes, methods and systems, as well as in the management of these projects. Postgraduate PhD students (ISCED97 level 6) engaged in R&D are included. \n\nThe OECD's Frascati Manual defines research and experimental development as \"creative work undertaken on a systemic basis in order to increase the stock of knowledge, including knowledge of man, culture and society, and the use of this stock of knowledge to devise new applications.\" R&D covers basic research, applied research, and experimental development.\n\n(1) Basic research - Basic research is experimental or theoretical work undertaken primarily to acquire new knowledge of the underlying foundation of phenomena and observable facts, without any particular application or use in view.\n\n(2) Applied research - Applied research is also original investigation undertaken in order to acquire new knowledge; it is, however, directed primarily towards a specific practical aim or objective.\n\n(3) Experimental development - Experimental development is systematic work, drawing on existing knowledge gained from research and/or practical experience, which is directed to producing new materials, products or devices, to installing new processes, systems and services, or to improving substantially those already produced or installed.\n\nThe fields of science and technology used to classify R&D according to the Revised Fields of Science and Technology Classification are:\n1. Natural sciences;\n2. Engineering and technology;\n3. Medical and health sciences;\n4. Agricultural sciences;\n5. Social sciences;\n6. Humanities.\n"}}},"entityKey":{}}
