Therefore, OWID team calculated the number of the missing variable subtracting the sum of the observed regions from the World Total. For example, dis-aggregated data is not available for Middle East and North Africa (MENA) in 2013:\n\nMENA 2013 = World Total - (East Asia and Pacific + Europe and Central Asia + Latin America and the Caribbean + South Asia + Sub-Saharan Africa).\n\nWarning:\nThe most recent figures from the MENA reason do not necessarily reflect the geopolitical turmoil in the region.\n\nHigh-income countries are not included in PovcalNet tables used for this calculations."}}}}
