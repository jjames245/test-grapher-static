The three components were equally weighted (HHI-PD score = [stunting (%) + anemia (%) + low serum retinol (%)]/3).\n\nThe HHI-PD score ranged between the best and worst possible scores of 0 and 100, respectively. Applying arbitrary cut-offs, HHI-PD scores between 0 and 19.9 were considered mild, 20-34.9 as moderate, 35-44.9 as severe, and 45-100 as alarmingly high. Highly developed countries with a 2007 Human Development Index (HDI) score above 0.9 (n=41) were assumed to have a low prevalence of micronutrient deficiencies, and were therefore excluded from this analysis.\n\nData on micronutrient deficiencies used in this index relate to national-level analysis and surveys over the period 1999-2009."}},"8551":{"years":[],"entities":[],"values":[],"id":8551,"name":"Share of energy from cereals, roots and tubers (FAO (2017))","unit":"%","description":"Percentage of energy from cereals, roots and tubers.","created_at":"2017-07-27T22:20:03.000Z","updated_at":"2018-02-28T13:58:34.000Z","uploaded_at":"2017-07-27T22:20:03.000Z","code":null,"coverage":"global by country","timespan":"1991-2011","datasetId":650,"variableTypeId":3,"sourceId":2800,"uploaded_by":"Hannah.Ritchie","display":{},"shortUnit":"%","datasetName":"Share of energy from cereals, roots and tubers - FAO (2017)","s_id":2800,"s_name":"Share of energy from cereals, roots and tubers - FAO (2017)","source":{"id":2800,"name":"Share of energy from cereals, roots and tubers - FAO (2017)","dataPublishedBy":"United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) Food Security Indicators","dataPublisherSource":"Food Balance Sheets and Household Survey Data","link":"http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/FS","retrievedData":"","additionalInfo":"This data details the average share of dietary energy supplied by cereals, roots or tuber food commodities.
