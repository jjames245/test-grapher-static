Employment is defined as persons of working age who, during a short reference period, were engaged in any activity to produce goods or provide services for pay or profit, whether at work during the reference period (i.e. who worked in a job for at least one hour) or not at work due to temporary absence from a job, or to working-time arrangements. Ages 15 and older are generally considered the working-age population.","created_at":"2017-07-06T12:50:09.000Z","updated_at":"2018-02-28T13:58:30.000Z","uploaded_at":"2017-07-06T12:50:09.000Z","code":"SL.EMP.TOTL.SP.FE.ZS","coverage":"","timespan":"1960-2016","datasetId":560,"variableTypeId":4,"sourceId":1682,"uploaded_by":null,"display":{},"shortUnit":"%","datasetName":"World Development Indicators - Social Protection & Labor","s_id":1682,"s_name":"World Bank – WDI: Employment to population ratio, 15+, female (%) (modeled ILO estimate)","source":{"id":1682,"name":"World Bank – WDI: Employment to population ratio, 15+, female (%) (modeled ILO estimate)","dataPublishedBy":"World Bank – World Development Indicators","dataPublisherSource":"International Labour Organization, ILOSTAT database.

The labor force survey is the most comprehensive source for internationally comparable employment, but there are still some limitations for comparing data across countries and over time even within a country. \n\nComparability of employment ratios across countries is affected by variations in definitions of employment and population. The biggest difference results from the age range used to define labor force activity. The population base for employment ratios can also vary. Most countries use the resident, non-institutionalized population of working age living in private households, which excludes members of the armed forces and individuals residing in mental, penal, or other types of institutions. But some countries include members of the armed forces in the population base of their employment ratio while excluding them from employment data.\n\nThe reference period of a census or survey is another important source of differences: in some countries data refer to people's status on the day of the census or survey or during a specific period before the inquiry date, while in others data are recorded without reference to any period. Employment ratios tend to vary during the year as seasonal workers enter and leave.\n\nThis indicator also has a gender bias because women who do not consider their work employment or who are not perceived as working tend to be undercounted. This bias has different effects across countries and reflects demographic, social, legal, and cultural trends and norms.\nGeneral comments: Data up to 2016 are estimates while data from 2017 are projections. National estimates are also available in the WDI database. Caution should be used when comparing ILO estimates with national estimates.\nStatistical concept and methodology: The employment to population ratio indicates how efficiently an economy provides jobs for people who want to work. A high ratio means that a large proportion of the population is employed. But a lower employment to population ratio can be seen as a positive sign, especially for young people, if it is caused by an increase in their education. \n\nThe series is part of the ILO estimates and is harmonized to ensure comparability across countries and over time by accounting for differences in data source, scope of coverage, methodology, and other country-specific factors. The estimates are based mainly on nationally representative labor force surveys, with other sources (population censuses and nationally reported estimates) used only when no survey data are available.\n"}}},"entityKey":{}}
