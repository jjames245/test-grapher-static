Contraceptive prevalence rates are obtained mainly from household surveys, including Demographic and Health Surveys, Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys, and contraceptive prevalence surveys. Unmarried women are often excluded from such surveys, which may bias the estimates.\n"}},"3357":{"years":[],"entities":[],"values":[],"id":3357,"name":"Contraceptive prevalence, modern methods (% of women ages 15-49)","unit":"% of women ages 15-49","description":"Contraceptive prevalence rate is the percentage of women who are practicing, or whose sexual partners are practicing, at least one modern method of contraception.
