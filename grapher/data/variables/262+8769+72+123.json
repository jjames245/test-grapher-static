The granularity of these data were reduced to observations (i) every 5,000 years from from 10,000BCE to 0CE; (ii) every 500 years from 0-1,950CE; and (iii) every 5 years thereafter. (2) Observations for Australia exclude Heard and McDonald Island. (3) Observations for the United Kingdom exclude the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. (4) The original HYDE data had a series for Serbia and Montenegro; this series was dropped and series for the two separate countries were kept (Kosovo included in Serbia)."}},"8769":{"years":[],"entities":[],"values":[],"id":8769,"name":"Cropland per capita (HYDE (2017))","unit":"hectares per person","description":"Cropland per person, in hectares.","created_at":"2017-08-24T21:42:01.000Z","updated_at":"2018-02-28T13:58:34.000Z","uploaded_at":"2017-09-07T13:58:35.000Z","code":null,"coverage":"global by region","timespan":"-10000-2016","datasetId":694,"variableTypeId":3,"sourceId":2854,"uploaded_by":"Hannah.Ritchie","display":{},"shortUnit":"hecatres","datasetName":"Land Use Data - HYDE (2017)","s_id":2854,"s_name":"Land Use Data - HYDE (2017)","source":{"id":2854,"name":"Land Use Data - HYDE (2017)","dataPublishedBy":"History Database of the Global Environment (HYDE)","dataPublisherSource":"","link":"http://themasites.pbl.nl/tridion/en/themasites/hyde/","retrievedData":"","additionalInfo":"The authors of the database provide the following definition clarifications for land use categories:\n\n'Cropland' refers to the same FAO category titled 'arable land and permanent crops'.\n\n'Grazing' refers to the FAO category titled 'permanent meadows and pastures'.\n\n'Pastureland' refers to \"Grazing land with an aridity index > 0.5, assumed to be more intensively managed\".\n\n'Rangeland' refers to \"Grazing land with an aridity index > 0.5, assumed to be less or not managed\".\n\nArea values have been converted from square kilometres to hectares by multiplying by 100.\n\nFull reference: Klein Goldewijk et al., 20xx (in prep).
