Frequent illness saps the nutritional status of those who survive, locking them into a vicious cycle of recurring sickness and faltering growth (UNICEF, www.childinfo.org). Estimates of child malnutrition, based on prevalence of underweight and stunting, are from national survey data. The proportion of underweight children is the most common malnutrition indicator. Being even mildly underweight increases the risk of death and inhibits cognitive development in children. And it perpetuates the problem across generations, as malnourished women are more likely to have low-birth-weight babies. Stunting, or being below median height for age, is often used as a proxy for multifaceted deprivation and as an indicator of long-term changes in malnutrition.\n"}},"42563":{"years":[],"entities":[],"values":[],"id":42563,"name":"Income classifications (World Bank (2017))","unit":"","description":"Income classifications are split into four categories determined by the GNI per capita in US$ (Atlas methodology).","created_at":"2017-10-03T13:24:59.000Z","updated_at":"2018-02-28T13:58:52.000Z","uploaded_at":"2017-10-03T13:24:59.000Z","code":null,"coverage":"","timespan":"","datasetId":944,"variableTypeId":3,"sourceId":6803,"uploaded_by":"Diana","display":{},"shortUnit":null,"datasetName":"Income Classification - World Bank (2017)","s_id":6803,"s_name":"World Bank's, World Bank Analytical Classifications (2017)","source":{"id":6803,"name":"World Bank's, World Bank Analytical Classifications (2017)","dataPublishedBy":"World Bank WDI","dataPublisherSource":"The main source is gross national income (GNI) estimates obtained from economists in World Bank country units; and the size of the population is estimated by World Bank demographers from a variety of sources, including the UN's biennial 'World Population Prospects'.","link":"http://databank.worldbank.org/data/download/site-content/OGHIST.xls","retrievedData":"","additionalInfo":"–The Atlas methodology is used to reduce the impact of exchange rate fluctuations in the cross-country comparison of national incomes. The Atlas conversion factor for any year is the average of a country's exchange rate for that year and its exchange rates for the two preceding years, adjusted for the differences between the rate of inflation in the country and that in Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Euro area. A country's inflation rate is measured by the change in its GDP deflator. The inflation rate for the above countries, representing international inflation, is measured by the changes in the SDR deflator.
