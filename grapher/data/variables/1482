The first four of these indicators carry a weight of one sixth each (i.e. 0.166). The other six have a weight of one eighteenth each (i.e. 0.055)\r\n\r\nSurvey data\r\n\r\nYears correspond to the year reported for the underlying survey used as source in each country. Whenever surveys correspond to year intervals (e.g. 2011-2012), we display the end year for that interval.\r\n\r\nThe source notes that \"The global MPI was first released in 2010, for 104 developing countries, and has been updated yearly with the latest data available. Starting from winter 2014/2015, updates are now made twice a year, in summer and winter. In June 2015, the Global MPI was updated for 32 countries and 6 new countries have been added to the list of those last reported in 2014. In total it now covers 101 developing countries, using data ranging from 2005 to 2014.\""}}}}
