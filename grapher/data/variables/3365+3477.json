Therefore they may not reflect real events as much as observed data.\nGeneral comments: Relevance to gender indicator: it can indicate the status of women within households and a woman’s decision about the number and spacing of children.\nStatistical concept and methodology: Total fertility rates are based on data on registered live births from vital registration systems or, in the absence of such systems, from censuses or sample surveys. The estimated rates are generally considered reliable measures of fertility in the recent past. Where no empirical information on age-specific fertility rates is available, a model is used to estimate the share of births to adolescents. For countries without vital registration systems fertility rates are generally based on extrapolations from trends observed in censuses or surveys from earlier years.\n"}},"3477":{"years":[],"entities":[],"values":[],"id":3477,"name":"Wanted fertility rate (births per woman)","unit":"births per woman","description":"Wanted fertility rate is an estimate of what the total fertility rate would be if all unwanted births were avoided.","created_at":"2017-07-06T13:03:36.000Z","updated_at":"2018-02-28T13:58:31.000Z","uploaded_at":"2017-07-06T13:03:36.000Z","code":"SP.DYN.WFRT","coverage":"","timespan":"1960-2016","datasetId":563,"variableTypeId":4,"sourceId":2139,"uploaded_by":null,"display":{},"shortUnit":"births","datasetName":"World Development Indicators - Health","s_id":2139,"s_name":"World Bank – WDI: Wanted fertility rate (births per woman)","source":{"id":2139,"name":"World Bank – WDI: Wanted fertility rate (births per woman)","dataPublishedBy":"World Bank – World Development Indicators","dataPublisherSource":"Demographic and Health Surveys.","link":"http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators","retrievedData":"","additionalInfo":""}}},"entityKey":{}}
