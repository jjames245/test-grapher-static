An international sample of 18,787 adults aged 18-64 in the US and Canada, and age 16-64 in all other countries, were interviewed between May 6 and May 21, 2011 via the Ipsos Online Panel system.\r\n\r\nResults presented here are in response to the question: \"Please indicate whether you strongly support, somewhat support, somewhat oppose, or strongly oppose each way of producing electricity\" [results for nuclear electricity production].\r\n\r\nFour responses were accepted for this question: \"strongly support\"; \"somewhat support\"; \"somewhat oppose\"; and \"strongly oppose\". We have simplified these results to \"support\" and \"oppose\" by summing the former and latter two responses, respectively."}}}}
